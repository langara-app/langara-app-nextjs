        description: "In 2020, WMDD decided to revamp its website to give people a better look at the curriculum and see the outstanding success of its students throughout the program. The website needed a change in visual design and user experience to improve the usability and efficiency of user interaction with the current site. Chloe Bui, Ken Tauchi and Hiteshri Nanda, three students from the WMDD program worked together from September 2020 to December 2020 to implement the new changes.",
        description2: "From January 2021 to April 2021 Ken Tauchi continued working on the website, joined by Kristen Ingelman, Azusa Nakahashi and Shen Gianni. These WMDD students worked together to further improve the WMDD website, giving the website a whole new design. From the start in September 2020, all weekly team meetings have been held on Zoom."
